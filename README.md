## Installation

## API Configuration:

The application fetches data from [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com). No further configuration is required for development since the API is publicly accessible.

## How It Works

- **API Integration:** The app uses the DummyJSON API to fetch recipes and user data. This enables dynamic recipe search and user authentication for login functionality.
- **User Authentication:** The login functionality ensures that users can securely log in, with the app fetching their authentication data from the DummyJSON API. Once logged in, users can see personalized content.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts seamlessly across devices, ensuring an optimal experience whether on a mobile phone or a desktop computer.
